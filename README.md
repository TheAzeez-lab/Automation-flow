# 👷‍♂️ Workflow Automation & Data Science in Manufacturing Operations

Hi, I'm **Odubiyi Azeez** — a Food Scientist with a passion for **workflow automation** and **data-driven operations** in the manufacturing space. I build smart solutions using **Power Automate**, **Google Apps Script**, and **Python** to reduce manual effort, increase accountability, and support timely decision-making.

This repository showcases some of my practical contributions toward streamlining operations in a fast-paced production environment.

## 🏭 Manufacturing-Focused Projects

### 🔁 1. Staff Birthday Flow Automation (Power Automate)
An automated two-phase notification flow:
- Notifies HR a day before staff birthdays for preparation
- Sends a birthday message on the actual day

✅ Boosts staff morale  
✅ Reduces manual tracking  
✅ Fully integrated with Excel Online and Outlook

---

### 🔁 2. Action Tracker Follow-Up Reminder (Power Automate)
Built to improve accountability in closing out production or quality actions (e.g., CAPA or RCA tasks).

- Sends reminders every 72 hours until task is marked “closed”
- Escalates to supervisors if overdue

✅ Supports QMS compliance  
✅ Reduces task backlog  
✅ Improves closure rate

---

### 🧾 3. Task Escalation & Notification System (Google Apps Script)
Created an automated script to:
- Monitor updates in Google Sheets
- Send email notifications based on task status and deadlines
- Highlight overdue tasks to supervisors automatically

✅ Lightweight and cost-effective  
✅ No external tools needed  
✅ Ideal for small-to-medium factory teams using G-Suite

---

### 🧹 4. Data Cleaning & Preparation Script (Python)
Cleaned a messy food safety dataset with the following issues:
- Improper datetime format (e.g., "45671" instead of standard date)
- Mismatched columns between related sheets
- Missing or inconsistent values

**Used:** `pandas`, `datetime`, `numpy`  
✅ Ready for visualization or RCA analysis  
✅ Supports clean reporting of contamination trends across states and food types
